Solutions to some of Advent of Code problems.

The main point of this project is to learn more functional programming patterns 
using Clojure programming language.

The solutions to the problems are mostly straightforward and simple.
Some of the solutions are still work in progress and being worked on.

How to run solutions
--------------------

I don't use project management tools here (for simplicity), so every `.clj`
can be run with either standard clojure interpreter or with babashka.
